# IP Changer Script

The IP Changer Script is a Python-based tool that allows you to change the IP address of your network interface on Linux, Windows, or macOS systems. This script can be useful for various purposes, such as testing network configurations, privacy protection, or overcoming network restrictions. However, please use it responsibly, as frequent IP changes can disrupt network connectivity and may not comply with network policies.

## Features

- Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.
- Generates random IP addresses (for demonstration purposes) for automatic IP address changes.
- Configurable interval for IP address changes.
- Simple and easy-to-use Python script.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your system.
- Administrative privileges to modify network configurations (for Windows and macOS).
- Basic knowledge of your network interface name (e.g., eth0, wlan0, Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your system.
2. Open the script in a text editor.

3. Replace `"YOUR_INTERFACE_NAME"` in the script with the name of your network interface (e.g., "eth0", "Ethernet", "Wi-Fi").

4. Optionally, modify the script to use a specific IP address or IP address range if needed.

5. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python ip_changer.py
